Heavy Metal Pollution Index Calculator

Background

The presence of heavy metals in drinking water, even at trace levels, poses significant health risks, making accurate and timely assessment critical for public safety and environmental monitoring. Although several indices exist for assessing heavy metal pollution, their manual computation is tedious, time-consuming, inconsistent, and vulnerable to human error due to the complexity and variability of formulas.

Proposed Solution

It is proposed to develop an automated, user-friendly application that can compute Heavy Metal Pollution Indices (HMPI) in groundwater using standard formulas with minimal manual intervention. This tool will streamline calculations, reduce errors, and provide reliable outputs for stakeholders.

Key Features
- Automated computation of heavy metal pollution indices using standard methodologies
- Integration of groundwater heavy metal concentration datasets with geo-coordinates
- Categorization of groundwater quality based on heavy metal presence
- User-friendly interface for scientists, researchers, and policymakers
- Reduction of manual effort and error-prone processes

Impact

The application will provide accessible and reliable insights into groundwater heavy metal contamination, enabling better decision-making, enhanced environmental monitoring, and improved public health protection.


Our Proposed Feature Ideas :-
1. All Proposed Features by SIH
2. Data graphs for Whole Year
3. Login/Auth and data saving system
4. Combining multiple data base to show the values for the whole map

Current Road Map :-
1. Basic Data Processing Module which takes CSV or Excel as input and converts it to a data frame.

2. HMPI Calculator Module.

3. Generate a basic output file with HPMI Column added.

4. Good Looking UI, and Result shown directly on webpage instead of seperate spreadsheet.

5. Follium/Map Integration for basic HMPI with colored values for quality index.

6. Generate Maps and Trends based on Time Stamped Data.

7. Add PDF as a valid input for Data Processing.

8. Add the functionality to directly produce a report which combines the input data, HMPI, Map, Graphs, Trends etc into a single PDF for easy access or reasearch 

9. Add User Signup/Login system to maintain and save a data base uploaded by a user for multiple uses.

10. With consent from the user, use their database to produce a combined map for all HMPI calculation
