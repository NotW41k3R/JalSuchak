Heavy Metal Pollution Index Calculator

Background

The presence of heavy metals in drinking water, even at trace levels, poses significant health risks, making accurate and timely assessment critical for public safety and environmental monitoring. Although several indices exist for assessing heavy metal pollution, their manual computation is tedious, time-consuming, inconsistent, and vulnerable to human error due to the complexity and variability of formulas.

Proposed Solution

It is proposed to develop an automated, user-friendly application that can compute Heavy Metal Pollution Indices (HMPI) in groundwater using standard formulas with minimal manual intervention. This tool will streamline calculations, reduce errors, and provide reliable outputs for stakeholders.

Key Features
- Automated computation of heavy metal pollution indices using standard methodologies
- Integration of groundwater heavy metal concentration datasets with geo-coordinates
- Categorization of groundwater quality based on heavy metal presence
- User-friendly interface for scientists, researchers, and policymakers
- Reduction of manual effort and error-prone processes

Impact

The application will provide accessible and reliable insights into groundwater heavy metal contamination, enabling better decision-making, enhanced environmental monitoring, and improved public health protection.
